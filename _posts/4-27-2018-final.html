title: First thoughts on final project
---

<p>I think I want to make phone amplifiers using 3D printing. Its a phone stand that has a tube from
the phone's speaker, the tube faces outwards and expands in diameter as it goes on. This design holds the phone
and increases the volume of the phones speaker. </p>

<p> To do this project, I have to learn to design this amplifier using design software. In addition, I would have to
learn to 3D print objects.</p>

<p>My first steps would be researching the design and begining to actually design it.</p>
